# MD5 message-digest algorithm - Report

## Introduction
The algorithm takes as input a message of arbitrary length and produces as output a 128-bit "fingerprint" or "message digest" of the input. The MD5 algorithm is designed to be quite fast on 32-bit machines. In addition, the MD5 algorithm does not require any large substitution tables; the algorithm can be coded quite compactly. MD5 is used for verifying files and transmissions, it should never be used for more as its very easy to break.


## Run

1. Clone the repo

```
git clone https://github.com/DarrenRegan/Theory-of-Algorithms-Project.git
```

2. cd Theory-of-Algorithms-Project and run commands
```
make md5
./md5 test.txt
```

## Test
The following five steps are performed to compute the message digest of the message.

## Algorithm
